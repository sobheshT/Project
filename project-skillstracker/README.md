# Skill Management System 
 
**Problem Statement:** We need to develop Skill Management single page application, which is used to keep track of skills of the employees. 
 
The Academic Manager wants a single page application to keep track of skills of individual Full Stack Engineers. Using this internal portal the manager should be able to perform following operations:  
 
• **Search Associate:** 

John will be able to search associate with following criteria: 
○ Search by associate name 
○ Search by associate ID 
○ Search by Email ID 
○ Search by Mobile Number 
○ Search by Strong Skills 
 
● **Add new Associate:** 

John will be able to add new associate and its respective Full Stack Development Skills. 

● **Edit, Delete & View Associate:** 

The associate which is searched can be updated, deleted and viewed. 

● **Add Skill:**

It will allow John to add new skills so that it can be used in “Add New Associate” page.
